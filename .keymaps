# before limiting to 15, there was some errors like,
# Ctrl works as Ctrl (while should works as Cmd)
# and also after Cmd(as Ctrl) pressed, I can't type regular letters
# (i.e. like Cmd works as Ctrl_Locked (toggler)), regular letters however
# works only after Alt-Enter
keymaps 0-15
# left
keycode 29 = Alt # 29 == L_Ctrl/Control
keycode 125 = Control # 125 == L_Cmd/Alt
# right
keycode 97 = Alt # 97 == R_Ctrl/Control
keycode 126 = Control # 126 == R_Cmd/Alt
