! This is the layout for the generic pc keyboard
! (tested on ThinkPad Carbon X1 6th Gen internal keyboard)
!
! It changes next keys:
! - key Alt is not act as Ctrl
! - key Win is not act as Alt
! - key Ctrl is not act as Win
! It was done because of readline bindings

clear Control
clear Mod4
clear Mod1

keysym Control_L = Super_L
keysym Control_R = Super_R
keysym Super_L   = Alt_L
keysym Alt_L     = Control_L
keysym Alt_R     = Control_R

add Control = Control_L Control_R
add Mod4    = Super_L Super_R
add Mod1    = Alt_L Alt_R
