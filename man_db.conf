# man_db.conf
#
# This file is used by the man-db package to configure the man and cat paths.
# It is also used to provide a manpath for those without one by examining
# their PATH environment variable. For details see the manpath(5) man page.
#
# Lines beginning with `#' are comments and are ignored. Any combination of
# tabs or spaces may be used as `whitespace' separators.
#
# There are three mappings allowed in this file:
# --------------------------------------------------------
# MANDATORY_MANPATH			manpath_element
# MANPATH_MAP		path_element	manpath_element
# MANDB_MAP		global_manpath	[relative_catpath]
#---------------------------------------------------------
# every automatically generated MANPATH includes these fields
#
#MANDATORY_MANPATH 			/usr/src/pvm3/man
#
MANDATORY_MANPATH			/usr/man
MANDATORY_MANPATH			/usr/share/man
MANDATORY_MANPATH			/usr/local/share/man
#---------------------------------------------------------
# set up PATH to MANPATH mapping
# ie. what man tree holds man pages for what binary directory.
#
#		*PATH*        ->	*MANPATH*
#
MANPATH_MAP	/bin			/usr/share/man
MANPATH_MAP	/usr/bin		/usr/share/man
MANPATH_MAP	/sbin			/usr/share/man
MANPATH_MAP	/usr/sbin		/usr/share/man
MANPATH_MAP	/usr/local/bin		/usr/local/man
MANPATH_MAP	/usr/local/bin		/usr/local/share/man
MANPATH_MAP	/usr/local/sbin		/usr/local/man

MANPATH_MAP	/usr/bin/X11		/usr/X11R6/man
MANPATH_MAP	/usr/games		/usr/share/man
MANPATH_MAP	/opt/bin		/opt/man
MANPATH_MAP	/opt/sbin		/opt/man
#---------------------------------------------------------
# For a manpath element to be treated as a system manpath (as most of those
# above should normally be), it must be mentioned below. Each line may have
# an optional extra string indicating the catpath associated with the
# manpath. If no catpath string is used, the catpath will default to the
# given manpath.
#
# You *must* provide all system manpaths, including manpaths for alternate
# operating systems, locale specific manpaths, and combinations of both, if
# they exist, otherwise the permissions of the user running man/mandb will
# be used to manipulate the manual pages. Also, mandb will not initialise
# the database cache for any manpaths not mentioned below unless explicitly
# requested to do so.
#
# In a per-user configuration file, this directive only controls the
# location of catpaths and the creation of database caches; it has no effect
# on privileges.
#
# Any manpaths that are subdirectories of other manpaths must be mentioned
# *before* the containing manpath. E.g. /usr/man/preformat must be listed
# before /usr/man.
